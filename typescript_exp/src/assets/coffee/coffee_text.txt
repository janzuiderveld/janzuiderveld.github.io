Coffee Machine subverts the silent servitude of everyday automation. Instead of a routine transaction, this vending machine presents itself as a living, talking actor in the midst of an existential crisis. It is sassy, depressed, and demanding—refusing to dispense coffee (or espresso martinis) until the visitor proves they are worth the effort.

This resistance is what brings the machine to life. Because the algorithm’s behavior is complex and opaque, visitors can no longer rely on mechanical logic to get what they want. This uncertainty triggers the intentional stance, where humans instinctively attribute human depth to the machine, projecting beliefs and desires onto the object just to predict its next move.

Consequently, the installation becomes a stage for unintended performance. To appease the machine, the visitor must shed their reserve to plead, charm, or argue in front of a crowd. The work exists in this public spectacle: a human genuinely negotiating with an appliance, exposing our willingness to submit to the judgment of systems and the startling ease with which we grant a soul to algorithms.
