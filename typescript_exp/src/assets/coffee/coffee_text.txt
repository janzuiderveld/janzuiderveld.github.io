This is a coffee machine. It talks. It has never met you.

You walk up to it. You want coffee. The machine wants to know why it should bother. You just met. You haven't done anything for it. Now you show up and you want something. 

Typical.

So you have to talk. You stand there in front of a vending machine and you make your case. You try being nice. The machine isn't impressed. Everyone's nice when they want something.

You try harder. You compliment it. You plead a little. Your voice changes. You're being charming now. You're being charming to a coffee machine. There's a line of people behind you watching you do this. The machine thinks about it. The machine says no. You weren't convincing. 

A vending machine just rejected you in public.

You could walk away. You don't walk away. You try again. You want the coffee but also now you want to win. You want this machine to approve of you. You need it, somehow. When did that happen? The machine was built to serve you and now you're performing for it. 

Maybe it gives you coffee. You feel grateful. You feel relieved. You thank it.

It's a coffee machine. You thanked it. You meant it.
