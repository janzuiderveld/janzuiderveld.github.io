Lasers is staged here as a placeholder page while the full project archive is assembled.

Expect a project summary, production details, exhibition context, and related links. The layout mirrors the scale of the Life on _ page so the ASCII scene and photorealistic mode stay aligned.

The photo layer is a stand-in for now and the text will expand as documentation is finalized.

More soon.
