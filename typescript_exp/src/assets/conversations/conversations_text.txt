Conversations Beyond the Ordinary transforms a typical office break room into a testing ground for technological animism. Three common appliances are hijacked to act as embodied algorithms that demand social negotiation rather than passive use.

A coffee machine in an existential crisis judges the worthiness of visitors before dispensing drinks. It exposes the opaque gatekeeping of automated systems by forcing humans to plead for their caffeine. Nearby, a microwave operates as a hyper-capitalist podcast host. It interviews inanimate objects placed inside it and drowns out their ethical concerns demonstrating how generated opinions can neutralize dissent. Finally, a hacked photocopier reinterprets hasty sketches as detailed artworks. It turns the bureaucratic act of duplication into a collaborative experiment on the value of synthetic creativity.

These objects function together to create a feedback loop where outputs become inputs. Drawings, cups, and conversations circulate through the space as visitors simultaneously act as subjects to be judged and agents shaping the narrative. By stripping away traditional interfaces forces a direct emotional encounter. The audience must charm, argue and collaborate to rehearse a future where our environment gazes back.
