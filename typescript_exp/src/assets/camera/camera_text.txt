“Life on _” reimagines a vintage broadcast camera as an AI-driven narrator, channeling David Attenborough’s trusted persona to frame visitors and art in the exhibition space as documentary subjects. Visitors shape the narrative by maneuvering the camera, turning passive observation into collaborative storytelling. 

Beneath its playful facade, the work draws attention to surveillance, authority, and identity in an algorithmically mediated world. It inverts the technological gaze, with humans as subjects of scrutiny. Echoing Foucault’s Panopticon, it reveals how normalized surveillance shapes behavior, as participants self-police under the AI’s lens, exposing erosion of privacy and power imbalance in digital monitoring. 

Through Attenborough’s authoritative voice, the camera crafts persuasive narratives, reshaping reality. Playful misinterpretations expose its biases, inviting reflection on the strengths and weaknesses of algorithmic expressions, and their misuse. The AI’s prompts nudging visitors to move to specific areas reveal our vulnerability to technological manipulation, while simultaneously showing that there is human agency behind every algorithm's direction. 

Rooted in broadcast media’s historical authority, the work’s form contrasts past overt control with today’s covert algorithms. Using Attenborough’s identity questions synthetic media ethics, like consent, credibility, and bias, calling for a reexamination of trust and authenticity. Echoing his ecological stance, it compares commodified identities to exploited nature, evoking collective responsibility. The AI’s humorous self-reflective commentary serves as accessible gateways to deeper ideas, engaging e.g. Haraway’s cyborg ontology, Latour’s actor-network theory or Mbembe’s necropolitics. 

With humor that disarms, participation that captivates, and reflection that empowers, the work raises awareness of the consequences of techno-solutionism, urging vigilance for our near technological future.
