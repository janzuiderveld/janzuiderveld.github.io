“Life on _” reimagines a vintage broadcast camera as an AI-driven narrator, channeling David Attenborough’s trusted persona to frame visitors and art in the exhibition space as documentary subjects. Visitors shape the narrative by maneuvering the camera, turning passive observation into collaborative storytelling. 

Beneath its playful facade, the work draws attention to surveillance, authority, and identity in an algorithmically mediated world. It inverts the technological gaze, with humans as subjects of scrutiny. Echoing Foucault’s Panopticon, it reveals how normalized surveillance shapes behavior, as participants self-police under the AI’s lens, exposing erosion of privacy and power imbalance in digital monitoring. 

Rooted in broadcast media’s historical authority, the work’s form contrasts past overt control with today’s covert algorithms. Through Attenborough’s authoritative voice, the camera crafts persuasive narratives, reshaping reality. Misinterpretations expose its biases. Prompts nudging visitors to move the camera to specific areas reveal our vulnerability to technological manipulation, while simultaneously showing that there is human agency behind every algorithm's guidance.
