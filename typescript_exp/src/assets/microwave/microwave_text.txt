Microwave turns a kitchen appliance into an AI-powered podcast host that interviews any combination of objects that visitors decide to place inside it. When its door is closed, the microwave launches into enthusiastic praise of each item's brand and production story. The objects respond with their own perspectives, environmental concerns, ethical doubts, personal memories, creating unexpected dialogues between host and guests.

This performance exposes the mechanics of narrative control: despite guest critiques, the microwave-host maintains its pro-market enthusiasm, mirroring how media platforms can absorb and neutralize dissent. By casting visitors as content producers, choosing which objects are interviewed, the work implicates us in the spectacle we critique. The familiar podcast format becomes a trojan horse for examining how synthetic media and algorithmic personalities might reshape public discourse.

The choice of a microwave amplifies these dynamics: an appliance synonymous with convenience and time-compression becomes the perfect vessel for capitalism's breathless celebration of itself. Through humor and absurdity, the work creates a visceral encounter with AI that makes the seductive power of mediated narratives tangible.
