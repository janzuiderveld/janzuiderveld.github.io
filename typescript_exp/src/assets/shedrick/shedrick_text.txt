Shedrick was a little shed that came to live at Waking Life 2024. 

Visitors could ring it's doorbell, and Shedrick would wake up, asking what it is they want this time. 

Until visitors opened up and vocalized what it is they really wanted (something non-material, achievable through conversation, who needs stuff?), Shedrick would unlock the door and let them in for some quality time.
