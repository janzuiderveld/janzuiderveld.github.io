Visitors sketch at a communal table and feed their drawings into a hacked Xerox photocopier. The copy machine, a symbol of mechanical reproduction and office monotony, scans their simple lines and reimagines them through AI synthesis: doodles become oil paintings, scribbles transform into woodcuts, stick figures emerge as detailed sculptures. This obsolete bureaucratic tool, hijacked and reborn, now serves as creative collaborator.

Copy Machine makes AI creativity tangible through physical gestures rather than text prompts. The familiar ritual of photocopying becomes a moment of co-authorship, where human intention guides machine interpretation. As visitors share their hybrid creations, the work stages a live experiment in value-making: some clutch their prints as treasured collaborations while others abandon them to the growing floor archive, uncertain whether AI-touched art deserves preservation.

This accumulation transforms the gallery floor into both artwork and evidence. The scattered drawings, ranging from careful sketches to hasty doodles, each bearing traces of human intention and machine interpretation, create a living document of our collective negotiation with AI creativity. Like a laboratory where experiments pile up, the installation visualizes how we assign worth when authorship blurs and originality becomes collaborative.

By repurposing the photocopier, Copy Machine grounds contemporary debates about AI art in immediate physical experience. Each visitor literally feeds the machine, negotiates creative control, and decides what to keep or discard, transforming abstract questions about human-AI collaboration into personal, tactile encounters that reshape understanding through play.
