Visitors sketch at a communal table and feed their doodles into a hacked Xerox photocopier. The copy machine, a symbol of mechanical reproduction and office monotony, is hacked to scan input, infer content, and reimagine it in diverse artistic styles through machine learning algorithms. The obsolete tool now serves as a creative collaborator.

Copy Machine makes AI creativity tangible through physical gestures rather than text prompts. The familiar ritual of photocopying becomes a moment of co-authorship, where human intention guides machine interpretation. The work stages a live experiment in value-making: some clutch their output prints as treasured collaborations while others abandon them to the growing floor archive, uncertain whether AI-touched art deserves preservation.

These scattered prints create a living document of local collective negotiation with AI creativity. The installation visualizes how we assign worth when authorship blurs and originality becomes collaborative.

By repurposing the photocopier, Copy Machine grounds contemporary debates about AI art in immediate physical experience. Each visitor literally feeds the machine, negotiates creative control, and decides what to keep or discard, transforming abstract questions about human-AI collaboration into personal, tactile encounters that reshape understanding through play.
